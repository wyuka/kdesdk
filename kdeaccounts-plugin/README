This is a KDE Addressbook Plugin, that is able to parse the file containing
names and email addresses of all KDE SVN accounts and puts them into your
addressbook. Very handy being able to auto-complete all those KDE developers
in KMail :)

After installing, fire up kcontrol, open the Addressbook configuration,
select Add -> "file", enter a descriptive name like "KDE SVN Accounts",
check the "Read-only" option and select "KDE Repository Accounts" from the
dropdown list. Finally, enter the full path to the "accounts" file
(in SVN, it's in the "kde-common" module).

That should be all :)
